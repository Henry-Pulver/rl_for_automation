# Reinforcement Learning for Automation

This is the code accompanying 2020 Master's Thesis Project entitled 'Reinforcement 
Learning for Automation' supervised by Dr. Sumeetpal Singh.

### Project layout
-```algorithms```: Core algorithms and classes used for recording plots, parsing the command line and training agents

-```envs``` : Assortment of tools used for environments used in the project. Includes a purpose-built
gridworld environment and hand-crafted algorithms used on Mountain Car

-```imitation_learning``` : Training scripts for imitation learning

-```plotting``` : Plots recorded data from training

-```reinforcement_learning``` : Training scripts for reinforcement learning

-```solved_networks``` : Set of PyTorch `.pth` files that represent the best performance 
achieved on the environments listed

-```tests``` : Several tests for key functionality
